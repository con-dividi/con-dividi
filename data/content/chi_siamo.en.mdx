<h1 class="text-fucsia text-2xl text-center">Con-dividi!</h1> <br />
<br />
It is from this name that the idea takes shape, after a long and intense journey of meeting with numerous families and friends,
to create a place where children and people of all ages can have the opportunity to meet, get to know each other, and indeed
share their experiences and talents. <br />
At the Con-dividi Center, meetings, exhibitions, workshops, and debates are organized to spread awareness and
sensitivity to the themes of childhood, adolescence, and family.
<br />
It caters to various types of users, of all ages, particularly children aged 0 to 12, and the specific needs of the
family, whether it be traditional, single-parent, and all their members: mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts, and
uncles. <br />
The Association is non-political, non-denominational, and non-profit, entirely managed by volunteers who represent the true
strength of the Center, committed to expressing authentic values and supporting our activities.
